# TwitchFa Chat

## Description
A bridge for Iranians who are restricted to access `twitch.tv`.

- The video player is for android browser (tested in android 12, idk if it works on lower version of androids)

## TODO List
1. set default quality, when page is loaded, play the stream automatically
2. Design a custom controler (the functions kinda ready, `playStream()` and `muteStream()`)
3. Send chat (maybe never added, because it require loging in or enter api code or something)
4. Get app working perfectly fine in android web browser and desktop browser

## Built with
* javascript
* tmi.js
